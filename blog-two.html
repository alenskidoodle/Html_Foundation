			<h2>Understanding Javascript</h2>
			<p>Posted by <strong>Royce Allen Arcilla</strong></p>
		</header>

		<h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>

		<p>
			<strong>JavaScript</strong> often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>JavaScript</strong> is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the <em>ECMAScript</em> standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multiparadigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the <em>Document Object Model (DOM).</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			The <strong> ECMAScript</strong> standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
		</p>

		<p>
			JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
		</p>

		<h3>Website Client-side Usage</h3>

		<p>
			JavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web, with 99% of all websites using it for this purpose.[10] Scripts are embedded in or included from HTML documents and interact with the DOM.
		</p>

		<p>
			All major web browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine that executes the code on the 	user's device.
		</p>

		<h4>Examples of Scripted Behavior</h4>

		<ul>
			<li>Loading new web page content without reloading the page, via Ajax or a WebSocket. Forexample, users of social media can send and receive messages without leaving the current page.
			</li>
			<li>Web page animations, such as fading objects in and out, resizing, and moving them.</li>
			<li>Playing browser games.</li>
			<li>Controlling the playback of streaming media.</li>
			<li>Generating pop-up ads or alert boxes.</li>
			<li> Validating input values of a web form before the data is sent to a web server.</li>
			<li>Logging data about the user's behavior then sending it to a server. The website owner can use this data for analytics, ad tracking, and personalization.</li>
			<li>Redirecting a user to another page.</li>
			<li>Storing and retrieving data on the user's device, via the storage or IndexedDB standards.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Web Libraries and Frameworks</h4>

		<p>
			<strong>React</strong> <em>(also known as React.js or ReactJS)</em> is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for
			building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a
			community of individual developers and companies.
		</p>

		<p>
			<stro>React</strong> can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like
			<strong>Next.js.</strong> Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM,
			React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality. A key advantage of React is that it only rerenders those parts of the page that have changed, avoiding unnecessary rerendering of unchanged DOM elements.
		</p>

		<h4>Angular</h4>

		<p>
			Angular (also referred to as "Angular 2+") is a TypeScript-based, free and open-source single-page web
			application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and
			corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS
		</p>

		<h4>jQuery</h4>

		<p>
			In 2012, jQuery was by far the most popular client-side library, used by over 75% of websites. While still in widespread use, its popularity has been surpassed by newer libraries and frameworks.
		</p>

		<h4>Vanilla JS</h4>

		<p>
			The framework-like moniker "Vanilla JS" is term that has been coined for websites not using any libraries or frameworks at all, instead relying entirely on standard JavaScript functionality.
